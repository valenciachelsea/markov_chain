# Identifying Critical Touchpoints in Purchaser Journey

## Markov Chain Method
The Markov Chain method is helpful in understanding how individuals move through a series of steps, pages in a website, or series of actions. This approach evaluates the liklihood of transitioning from one "state" to the next. By treating each action as a state and calculating the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another, the Markov Chain method can help identify the most impactful touchpoints. This method can also be used to evaluate removal effects, by determining how removal of a state will impact the overall flow of actions.

## Background
